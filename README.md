Here's a basic README template for your GitHub repository to help users understand how to run your virtual mouse project:

# Virtual Mouse Project

This project implements a virtual mouse using hand gestures. You can control the mouse cursor by moving your hand in front of a webcam and perform actions such as left-click, right-click, volume control, and opening files.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/varunkumar100804/Virtual_Mouse.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Virtual_Mouse
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the `app.py` script:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. A webcam window will open, showing your hand movements and the virtual mouse cursor.

3. Perform the following gestures:

   - Move your hand to move the cursor.
   - Raise one finger to left-click.
   - Raise two fingers to increase volume.
   - Raise three fingers to right-click.
   - Raise four fingers to open the file dialog.

4. Press 'q' in the webcam window to exit the program.

## Troubleshooting

- If the virtual mouse cursor doesn't respond correctly, adjust the threshold values in the code for finger detection (`d > 10000`).
